      <description>Where to start? Depending on the game, and how fleshed-out your idea is, the answer might be very different. In our case, I&amp;rsquo;ve cheated a little bit by making a prototype of the game already and working out a few of the ideas ahead of time. Still, it diverged a bit from my initial idea, and so might this series - time will tell.
In a bigger project, you might start with design document, which could be as simple as a page of notes or as complex as a 500-page treatise laying out every detail of your game&amp;rsquo;s world, plot, and mechanics.</description>

      <description>In the previous part, we created the Jumper and Circle object that make up the bulk of the game. Now we need to add the progression: a continuous series of spawned circles as long as the player doesn&amp;rsquo;t miss.
Expanding the Main scene Let&amp;rsquo;s add some more nodes to Main:
 Position2D (&amp;ldquo;StartPosition&amp;rdquo;)
This will mark the starting position for the game. Place it near the bottom-center of the screen.</description>
