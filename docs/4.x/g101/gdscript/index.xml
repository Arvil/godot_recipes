For example, a Sprite2D node automatically displays an image, but to move it across the screen, you&amp;rsquo;ll add a script that tells it how fast, in what direction, and so on.
You can think of it as the coding version of using the Inspector - GDScript knows all about Godot nodes and how to access them, plus it allows you to change them dynamically.</description></item></channel></rss>
