Solution The first step in getting an enemy to chase the player is to determine what direction the enemy needs to move. To get the vector pointing from A to B, you subtract: B - A. Normalize the result and you have a direction vector.
This makes the solution quite straightforward. Every frame, set the enemy&amp;rsquo;s velocity to point in the direction of the player.</description></item><item><title>Homing missile</title><link>https://godotrecipes.com/godot_recipes/4.x/ai/homing_missile/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://godotrecipes.com/godot_recipes/4.x/ai/homing_missile/index.html</guid><description>Problem You need a &amp;ldquo;homing missile&amp;rdquo; - a projectile that will seek a moving target.
Solution For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll use an Area2D node for the projectile. Areas are typically good choices for bullets because we need to detect when they contact something. If you also need a bullet that bounces/ricochets, one of the PhysicsBody type node might be a better choice.
The node setup and behavior of the missile is the same you would use for a &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; bullet.</description></item><item><title>Pet Following</title><link>https://godotrecipes.com/godot_recipes/4.x/ai/pet_following/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://godotrecipes.com/godot_recipes/4.x/ai/pet_following/index.html</guid><description>Problem You need to have a game entity such as a pet or minion, follow a character.
Solution We start by adding a Marker2D to the character. This will represent the place where the pet wants to &amp;ldquo;hang out&amp;rdquo; near the character.
In this example, we&amp;rsquo;ve made it a child of the Sprite2D, because the character&amp;rsquo;s code uses $Sprite2D.scale.x = -1 to flip the horizontal direction when the character moves left.</description></item></channel></rss>
