Solution For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded the art packs linked in the section description and unzipped them.
Before copying the files into your Godot project, notice that there are multiple versions of the assets in different file formats: OBJ, FBX, and GLTF. There are also some extra files such as examples and separate textures in case you want to modify them.</description></item></channel></rss>
