Solution Spritesheets are a common way for 2D animations to be distributed. In a spritesheet, all of the animation frames are packed into a single image.
For this demo, we&amp;rsquo;ll be using the excellent &amp;ldquo;Adventurer&amp;rdquo; sprite by Elthen. You can get this and lots of other great art athttps://elthen.itch.io/.
Warning Make sure the images in your spritesheet are laid out in a constant-sized grid.</description></item><item><title>Using the AnimationTree StateMachine</title><link>https://godotrecipes.com/godot_recipes/4.x/animation/using_animation_sm/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://godotrecipes.com/godot_recipes/4.x/animation/using_animation_sm/index.html</guid><description>Problem A common situation: you have a large number of animations, and it&amp;rsquo;s becoming difficult to manage transitions between them. Your code has become full of if statements, and every time you change something, it all breaks.
Solution Use an AnimationTree to create an animation state machine. This will allow us to organize our animations and most importantly, control the transitions between them.
Getting started For this demo, we&amp;rsquo;ll be using the excellent &amp;ldquo;Adventurer&amp;rdquo; sprite by Elthen.</description></item></channel></rss>
