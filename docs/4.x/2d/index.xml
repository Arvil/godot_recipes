Solution The engine provides a node for this: VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D. Attach this node to your object, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use its screen_entered and screen_exited signals.
Example 1 Consider a projectile that travels in a straight line after it&amp;rsquo;s fired. If we continue firing, eventually we&amp;rsquo;ll have a large number of objects for the engine to track, event though they&amp;rsquo;re offscreen, which can cause lag.</description></item><item><title>Platform character</title><link>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/2d/platform_character/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/2d/platform_character/</guid><description>Problem You need to make a 2D platform-style character.
Solution New developers are often surprised at how complex a platform character can be to program. Godot provides some built-in tools to assist, but there are as many solutions as there are games. In this tutorial, we won&amp;rsquo;t be going in-depth with features like double-jumps, crouching, wall-jumps, or animation. Here we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the fundamentals of platformer movement. See the rest of the recipes for other solutions.</description></item><item><title>Screen wrap</title><link>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/2d/screen_wrap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/2d/screen_wrap/</guid><description>Problem You want to allow the player to &amp;ldquo;wrap around&amp;rdquo; the screen, teleporting from one side of the screen to the other. This is a common feature, especially in old-school 2D games (think Pac-man).
Solution Get your screen (viewport) size
@onready var screen_size = get_viewport_rect().size get_viewport_rect() is available to any CanvasItem derived node.
Compare your player&amp;rsquo;s position
if position.x &amp;gt; screen_size.x: position.x = 0 if position.x &amp;lt; 0: position.x = screen_size.</description></item></channel></rss>
