Solution Even in 3D, cars tend to remain on the ground. For this reason, movement can (mostly) be treated as if it were 2D. Much of the car&amp;rsquo;s movement code will be very much like the 2D: Car Steering recipe. It&amp;rsquo;s recommended that you review that recipe before proceeding with this one.
Godot does provide a VehicleBody node, which is based on RigidBody and includes a complex simulation of engine, braking, suspension, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
