But the problem is that when you remove the object, the audio player goes with it, chopping off the sound. You need an easier way to manage playing audio.
Solution We&amp;rsquo;ll solve this problem with a node that is available from anywhere in the SceneTree. This node manages a set of AudioStreamPlayer nodes and a queue of sound streams to play.</description></item></channel></rss>
