## Problem

You're starting a new project. Soon, your project folder will be full of scenes, assets, scripts, and more. How do you keep it all organized?

## Solution

A common solution is to divide your project files into folders based on their game function. Your folder might look something like this:

```markdown
- res://
    - assets
        - textures
        - sounds
        - models
    - objects
        - entities
            - player
            - enemy
        -

```
