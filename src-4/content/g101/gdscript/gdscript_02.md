## Overview

Writing scripts and attaching them to nodes and other objects is how you build behavior and game mechanics into your game. For example, a {{< gd-icon Sprite2D >}}`Sprite2D` node automatically displays an image, but to move it across the screen, you'll add a script that tells it how fast, in what direction, and so on.

You can think of it as the coding version of using the Inspector - GDScript knows all about Godot nodes and how to access them, plus it allows you to change them dynamically.

GDScript is Godot's built-in language for scripting and interacting with nodes. The [GDScript documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html) on the Godot website is a great place to get an overview of the language, and I highly recommend taking the time to read through it.
