## <i class='fas fa-scroll'></i>&nbsp;GDScript

GDScript is Godot's built-in scripting language. Its syntax is based on Python, so if you're familiar with that language, you'll feel right at home. In this chapter, we'll introduce the language and get you up to speed with how it works.

{{% notice style="info" title="Updating to Godot 4.0" %}}
We're working on a new version of Godot 101 for Godot 4.0. In the meantime, we recommend new learners stick with Godot 3.x, which has a lot more resources and learning materials available.
