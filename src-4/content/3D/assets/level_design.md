## Problem

## Solution

We have several options to consider for designing our level:

* **GridMap**

    Using the built-in {{< gd-icon GridMap >}}`GridMap` node allows you to layout meshes in a grid in the editor. It's similar in concept to the 2D {{< gd-icon TileMap >}}`TileMap` node, though with less functionality.

    This option has a few drawbacks:

    1. The GridMap functionality in Godot is fairly rudimentary and hasn't been updated in some time.
    1. Placement is limited to a fixed grid layout, so you don't have as much control over how your meshes are placed.


* **Directly placing models**
