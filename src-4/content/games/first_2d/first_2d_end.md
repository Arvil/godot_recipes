If you've been following along, you've learned a lot of the fundamentals of building games in Godot. We're going to end the tutorial here, since we've completed the basic game.

{{% notice style="tip" title="The secret to learning effectively" %}}
Here's my big secret for getting the most out of tutorials like this and others you may find online. At the end, once you've finished building the project, immediately delete it and start over. This time, try and re-create it without looking at the tutorial. If you get stuck, look at *just* that part, then close it again.

It may sound repetitive, but that is how we learn: by doing things repeatedly. If you follow this tip, you'll be amazed at how quickly you level up your gamedev skills.

## Adding to the game

If you're feeling comfortable with the techniques used to make this game, then you're ready to branch out. Try adding a single new feature to this game.

If you're stuck coming up with an idea, here are some suggestions:

* **Additional enemy types** - there is art for other enemies in the art pack. How do they move and shoot?

* **Waves** - make more enemies spawn every time you clear the screen
* **Boss enemies** - what if a *big* enemy appears?
* **Boosts** - powerups could appear for the player to collect. There's some art for those too.
    * **Shield recharge** - collect these to power up the shield
    * **Weapon upgrades** - shoot more bullets, patterns, etc.
* **Sound and music** - give everything a lot more personality with some sound effects and background music.
